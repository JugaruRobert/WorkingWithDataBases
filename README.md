# WorkingWithDataBases-C-
Application I made in Microsoft Visual Studio - C# for learning to work with databases , calendar data and make a simple design for the app.

In this application the user can find what day it was in a certain calendar date using a formuloa.Also, the user can create an account, and can log in , to see a calendar. Simple dataBases work. Alse learning to use labels, buttons, comboBoxes.

! Open: open the appliocation from the "Aplicatie pe bune" folder which is inside the downloaded folder!

Some problems may appear if the databases are moved from the specific folder.IF downloaded, please update the path to the dataBases!
